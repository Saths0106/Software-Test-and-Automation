# CS320-Software-Test-and-Automation

1. I ensure my code is functional and secure by creating unit tests that target the logic in my program. The logic is where a bug is most likely to occur in a program and testing against it is a good idea to help catch as many bugs as possible

2. I interpret user needs by trying to code for all of the required functionality for the program and then trying to anticipate other potential uses for the program that a user might find and try. This way I can create a product the users want and will not easily find bugs in. 

3. I approach designing software by first understanding my requirements and trying to capture those requirements in the best way possible. I build to maintain security, increase my code readability, and reduce the likelihood of bugs by keeping my variables private and creating getters and setters if the variables need to be modified.
